Given a sequence of strings, the task is to find out the second most repeated (or frequent) string in the given sequence.

Note: No two strings are the second most repeated, there will be always a single string.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {aaa, bbb, ccc, bbb, aaa, aaa}
Output: bbb
Explanation: "bbb" is the second most 
occurring string with frequency 2.



map all the strings with their count and if count is greater than max then update max and update second max  with max and max with count and also string and second
string and if count is not greater than max but count is greater than second max but count not equals to max then update second max with count and update second string


string secFrequent (string arr[], int n)
    {
        //code here.
        unordered_map<string,int>m;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            m[arr[i]]++;
        }
        int max=INT_MIN;
        int sec=INT_MIN;
        string f="";
        string s="";
        for(auto x:m){
            if(x.second>max){
                s=f;
                sec=max;
               f=x.first;
                max=x.second;
            }
            else if(x.second>sec && x.second!=max){
                sec=x.second;
                s=x.first;
            }
            
        }
        return s;
    }
