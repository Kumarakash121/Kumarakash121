Given a positive integer X. The task is to find the smallest even number E such that
E > X and all digits in X and E are same.

Note: All the digits in X should be same with digits in E.

 

Example 1:

Input:
X = 34722641
Output:
34724126
Explanation:
Next greater number with same 
digits as in input is 34724126.




find next permutation and check if last digit is even or not if even return it else return -1


long long getNextEven(string x)
    {
        // Your code goes here   
        string e=x;
        
        while(next_permutation(e.begin(),e.end())){
            if((e.back()-'0')%2==0){
                return stoll(e);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N)! )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))
