Given an array Arr of positive integers of size N where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occuring odd number of times.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 5
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array all
element appear three times except 2
which appears once.



xor of odd frequency elements is equal to element
xor of even frequency elements is equal to 0

1^1^2^2^2=2


	int getSingle(int arr[], int n) {
	    // code here
	    int ans=0;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	        ans^=(arr[i]);
	    }
	    return ans;
	}
  
  
  
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
