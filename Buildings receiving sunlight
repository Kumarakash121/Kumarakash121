Given are the heights of certain Buildings which lie adjacent to each other. Sunlight starts falling from the left side of the buildings. If there is a building of a 
certain Height, all the buildings to the right side of it having lesser heights cannot see the sun. The task is to find the total number of such buildings that receive 
sunlight.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
H[] = {6, 2, 8, 4, 11, 13}
Output:
4
Explanation:
Only buildings of height 6, 8, 11 and
13 can see the sun, hence output is 4



take a curr variable intialize with 1st value and find height of a element which is greater than curr then increase count
and return count
int longest(int arr[],int n)
    {
        // Write your code here
        int  cnt=1;
        int curr=arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>=curr){
                curr=arr[i];
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
