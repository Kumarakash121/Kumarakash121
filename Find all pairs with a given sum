Given two unsorted arrays A of size N and B of size M of distinct elements, the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
B[] = {5, 6, 3, 4, 8} 
X = 9 
Output: 
1 8
4 5 
5 4
Explanation:
(1, 8), (4, 5), (5, 4) are the
pairs which sum to 9.



approach-

sort both the arrays take two pointers one at first element of first array and second pointer at last index of second array and if sum is equal to x then update a new
pair
and if sum is less than x then update i++ else j-- and return vector 


vector<pair<int,int>> allPairs(int A[], int B[], int N, int M, int X)
    {
        // Your code goes here   
        vector<pair<int,int>>v;
        sort(A,A+N);
        sort(B,B+M);
        int i=0;
        int j=M-1;
        while(i<N && j>=0){
            if(A[i]+B[j]==X){
                v.push_back({A[i],B[j]});
                i++;
                j--;
            }
            else if(A[i]+B[j]<X){
                i++;
            }
            else{
                j--;
            }
            
        }
        return v;
    }

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
