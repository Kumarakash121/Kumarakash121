Given a range of numbers starting with integer L and ending at R, the task is to count the numbers which have same first and last digits.

 

Example 1:

Input:
L = 7 
R = 68
Output:
9
Explanation:
Number with the same 
first and last digits 
in the given range is:
[7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 
44 ,55, 66].


 we can observe that in each ten number span we have only one number which has the given property except 1 to 10 which has 9 numbers (all one-digit numbers) having 
 the same starting and ending digit. 
Using above property we can solve given problem, first we break the given interval into two parts that is if interval is l to r, we break this into 1 to l and 1 to r,
our answer is obtained by subtracting result of first query from second query. 
Now we remain to find the count of numbers with given property in range 1 to x, for this, we divide x by 10, which gives the number of 10-spans. We add 9 to the span
for taking one-digit numbers into account. If the last digit of x is smaller than the first digit of x, then 1 should be decreased in the final answer to discard the 
last ten span number because that number is out of range. 












int count(int x){
      
      if(x<10){
          return x;
      }
      int tens=x/10;
      int res=tens+9;
      
      int p=x;
      while(p>=10){
          p/=10;
          }
      int last =x%10;
      if(last<p){
          res--;
      }
      return res;
      
  }
    int numbersInRange(int L, int R){
        // code here 
        
        if(L>R){
            return 0;
        }
        return count(R)-count(L-1);
        
    }
