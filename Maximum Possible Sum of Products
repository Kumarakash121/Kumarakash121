Maximum Possible Sum of Products
EasyAccuracy: 79.36%Submissions: 3015Points: 2
You will be given two arrays A and B of positive integers. The number of values in both the arrays will be the same say N. Your task is to find the maximum sum of products of their elements. Each element in A has to be multiplied with exactly one element in B and vice versa such that each element of both the arrays appears exactly once and the sum of product produced is maximum.

if A = {5,1,3,4,2} and B = {8,10,9,7,6} then a possible sum of product is 5*6 + 1*7 + 3*9 + 4*10 + 2*8.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1, 2, 3}
B[] = {4, 5, 1}
Output: 24
Explanation: 5*3 + 4*2 + 1*1 = 24



The idea is to observe that product of two maximum number will contribute toward the maximum sum of the product. So the idea is to: 

Sort both the arrays.
Traverse the arrays, and calculate the sum of products of array elements that are at the same index.


long long MaxSum(long long int A[], long long int B[], long long int N){
    //complete the function here
    sort(A,A+N);
    sort(B,B+N);
    long long product=0;
    for(int i=N-1;i>=0;i--){
        product+=(A[i]*B[i]);
    }
    return product;
}
