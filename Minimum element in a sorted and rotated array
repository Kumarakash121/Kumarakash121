A sorted(in ascending order) array A[ ] with distinct elements is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.

Example 1

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 ,5 ,1 ,2 ,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element inthe array.


approach-

use binary search take l=0 and h=n-1 and if mid is less than high element then update l=mid+1 else h=mid-1 and do while l<h and return low pointer element

 int findMin(int arr[], int n){
        //complete the function here
        int l=0;
        int h=n-1;
        
        while(l<h){
            int mid=(l+h)/2;
            
            if(arr[h]<arr[mid]){
                l=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                h=mid;
            }
        }
        return arr[l];
    }
    
    Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(log N).
