Given an array of integers and a number K. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size K in the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7, K = 4
A[] = {1,2,1,3,4,2,3}
Output: 3 4 4 3
Explanation: Window 1 of size k = 4 is
1 2 1 3. Number of distinct elements in
this window are 3. 
Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4. Number
of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2. Number
of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. Number
of distinct elements in this window are 3.




take a map and map evry element with its count and first map k elements and calculate map size and and similarly take two pointers and decrese first and increse 
second and calculate map size




vector <int> countDistinct (int A[], int n, int k)
    {
        //code here.
        unordered_map<int,int>m;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            m[A[i]]++;
        }
        vector<int>v;
        v.push_back(m.size());
        int i=0;
        int j=k;
        while(i<n-k){
            m[A[i]]--;
            m[A[j]]++;
            if(m[A[i]]==0){
                m.erase(A[i]);
                
            }
            // m[j]++;
            
            v.push_back(m.size());
             i++;
             j++;
        }
        return v;
    }

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
